  <ol>
      <li> Grab your sauce pan and put oil inside of it. Make sure to put enought to cover bottom of the whole pot.
          Let it heat up on medium high heat. Throw in the onion and let it cook in the oil. We want the oil to get some of that onion flavor.</li>
       <li> Once the onion cooks for about 1 minute throw in the uncooked rice. Occasionally stir it, we want it to fry a little. Make sure to keep an eye on the rice we dont want to burn it.
       <li> When you see that the rice looks like its been evenly fried throw in the tomato sauce, Knorr chicken flavored bouillon and stir it all together.
        <li> Next we stir in the two cups of water. Let it come to a boil and let it boil for 2 minutes.
       After those 2 minutes put the lid on the pot lower the heat to low and let it cook for 20 minutes. 
       Dont open the lid until to peak till those 20 minutes are up. </li>
       <li>Enjoy! That wasn't so hard now was it?
